You can execute this JavaScript command either from within the Code Composer Studio (search for "load scripting console command file or JavaScript" - this is the recommended method), or outside of Code Composer Studio using the following command:

```bash
/opt/ti/ccs1240/ccs/ccs_base/scripting/bin/dss.sh -dss.debug /zdata/progs/work/myopowers/icu-emu/tools/ccs_asm_extractor.js
```
